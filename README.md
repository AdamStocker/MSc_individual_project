# MSc_individual_project
This project involves mapping the distribution of a compressive wave type within the solar wind called slow mode waves. These can be categorised from their anticorrelation between the magnitude of the magnetic field and the plasma density of the solar wind. There are two .py files uploaded, the first is data_4000.py, this downloads magnetic field data and proton density data and finds the correlation and average of them over determined time frames. The average and corrolation are then saved as a CSV file. The ML_4000.py file reads these CSV files and finds clusters within this 2-d parameter space, and plots these clusters on graphs. The 4000 in the title of both files indicates that this was the 4th iteration attempt at producing this algorithm.   

The final report - used for my final MSc project has also been uploaded. All graphs were generated using the 2 scripts referenced above.
